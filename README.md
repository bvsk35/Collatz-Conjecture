# Collatz-Conjecture
This repo provides a small code for calculating the sequence.

- In this repo you can find a code for generating Collatz Conjecture Sequence for any given number (positive integer) or for a 
range of numbers (postive integers). 
- I have provided the code and additional binaary file for the first ~20k postive integers. 
- Also, I have plotted a nice graph between given integer and total no. of steps it takes to reach 1 (see the `Steps.pdf` file).
- I have also provided a function for fast calculation of the sequence from given number. 

Some details about the Conjecture: 

- The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1. 
- Paul Erd≈ës said about the Collatz conjecture: "Mathematics may not be ready for such problems." He also offered $500 for its solution. Jeffrey Lagarias in 2010 claimed that based only on known information about this problem, "this is an extraordinarily difficult problem, completely out of reach of present day mathematics."
